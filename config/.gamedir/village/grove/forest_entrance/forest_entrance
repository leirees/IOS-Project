Scarecrow: What the hell is that!
Tinman: I am Tin Man, I was created by some people that used me as an experiment. actually, in their words, i'm a piece of tin that has no use and no importance.
Scarecrow: oh that must have hurt. 
Tinman: not really, nothing can hurt me, i'm made of tin and i have no heart, so some people say i'm indestructible. 
Dog: <<Tries to bit he Tinman>>
Tinman: Hey buddy, you can hurt me but that’s not gentle.
Player: We are trying to get to the Admin to ask our desires, you could come with us to get your heart.
Tinman: Is it that even possible?... I have calculated the percentage of possibilities of achieving that aim and its less than 0.0001%. The Most Evil Bad Witch will find us before getting that. I think that having a heart will just make me weaker and easier to beat. I told you I'm almost indestructible like this.
